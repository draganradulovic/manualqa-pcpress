# manualqa-pcpress

In this project, the web page being tested is "Prodavnica" page of the pcpress.rs site.
URL: https://pcpress.rs/prodavnica/index.php

This project contains following documents:
1.Documentation - functionality requirements that the "Prodavnica" page must have.
2.Test scenario - list of test cases that must cover all possible use cases.
3.Test cases - defined steps for each test case, with expected results and testing data.
4.Defect reports - recorded defects, with additional defect details.

I have also automated positive test cases using Python language and its pyTest tool.
Automated cases are located in pytest-pcpress directory.
All test cases will be automated.
